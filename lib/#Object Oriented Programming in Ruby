#Object Oriented Programming in Ruby

##What is OO (Object Oritentation)?

- we will define objects
- providing organiztion and structure to your code
- encapsulation - we group together atrributes (data) and fuctionality
(methods)

## Ruby Classes
- Syntax:
```Ruby
class Breakfast
end
```
## Instatiating a class
- What is instantiation?
    - creating an instgance of an objects
    - scope comes into play - an instance of class creates its own scope
    - we have a blueprint, the class, and instantiation
    means creating one of those things, bringing the object "to life"

    ## Attributes of Ruby Classes
    
    
    ## Fuctionality of Ruby Classes
    - isntance methods are defined within the body of the class
    - syntax:
    ```ruby
    class MyClass
    #...
    def method_name(parameters)
    # method body
    end
    end
